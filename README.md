### Web Development

#### Frontend

Started SPA frontend development in 2011 with Backbone JS and soon went to Ember due to its opionated nature in terms of splitting of concerns when designing the frontend architecture, but actually soon after React JS and its design principles, ecosystem kicked my mind and still does. From my POV the React JS community did some very great effort in testing & inventing new concepts to make frontend development a breeze while staying flexible. But I also do some projects in Vue JS and Angular. Vue is a perfect fit when it comes to pocs and small web applications. Angular is good in terms of hiring people, as it bundles a lot out of the box and people know what to do. What I miss though in angular is modern principles in terms of state management. For example, there have been a lot of efforts in providing ngRX alternatives, but they dont seem to be that accepted in the community - thats different in the React space (think about Relay or generally the concept of pure functions without side effects being introduced by state management tools that use global stores).

#### Backend

I really liked the concept of writing code in one language with JavaScript in Golang cause its easier to build a full stack application but for years I believe thats not entirely "true": the runtime isn't that performant as other compiled binaries runnin on the server and the JS ecosystem often suffers bugs and versioning issues. There's a good read on that with a benchmark in this article when comparing runtime in a simple tcp backends: https://www.toptal.com/back-end/server-side-io-performance-node-php-java-go. Though, I would definitely always prefer Python when doing data intensive stuff as its perfectly optimized to Data investigation and transformation due to its ecosystem. So my favourite language of choice is Golang for most apps. When it comes to security sensitive applications I would vote for Rust although it has some new concepts that are hard to implement in the first steps of learning Rust like borrowing which definitely makes sense in terms of efficient & secure allocation and errors that can be spotted at compile time.

#### Infrastructure / Operations

Further very interested in integrating & securing services with Kubernetes and its NetworkPolicy, PodSecurityPolicy (to sad that it has been stopped being developed) as well as gRPC/protobuf and message queues like Apache Kafka. Docker is fun for me, especially when aiming to reduce the container & runtime size to the bare minimum with distros like Alpine :)

#### Web 3.0

I really appreciate the work of the ingenious minds at Bitcoin, Ethereum and other successors like Polkadot (üôå) and did some work with distributed technologies (and secure distributed data transfer) which has been successully security audited from cure53. We are currently implementing another protocol in Substrate with Rust due to the small. So if you are looking for support for your decentralized or even distributed project: drop me an email!

## Contact

I am looking forward to interesting chats about the different technologies, so feel free to touch base at [swift.boat8455@fastmail.com](mailto:swift.boat8455@fastmail.com).
