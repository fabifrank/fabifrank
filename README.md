# Hi, my name is Fabian (‚ó†Ôπè‚ó†) 

software & data engineer with passion for data analysis and machine learning.

## Stack

Usually focusing on one side of the fullstack development with react and/or golang, but also interested in the contrasts of different frameworks like angular, vue and svelte - I enjoy reading release histories and building pocs as it keeps you up-to-date with the development space of different areas.

Further very interested in integrating & securing services with Kubernetes and its NetworkPolicy, PodSecurityPolicy (to sad that it has been stopped being developed) as well as gRPC/protobuf and message queues like Apache Kafka. Docker is fun for me, especially when aiming to reduce the container & runtime size to the bare minimum with distros like Alpine :)

üôå I really appreciate the work of the ingenious minds at Bitcoin, Ethereum and other successors like Polkadot and did some work with distributed technologies (and secure distributed data transfer) which has been successully security audited from cure53. So if you are looking for support for your decentralized or even distributed project jump to the contact section and drop me an email!

## Contact

I am looking forward to interesting chats about the different technologies, so feel free to touch base at [swift.boat8455@fastmail.com](mailto:swift.boat8455@fastmail.com).
